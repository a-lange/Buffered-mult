This is a buffered mult, made in Kicad for 8HP format. 

I have not printed and tested it yet.

The front panel is reversible, the back has a simpler layout with no logo, text or copier.

Use it however you like.

The text says 'copier' in Norwegian, and the creature on the bottom is the friendly "ullmann"(wool-man).
